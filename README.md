My solutions to the problem sets from the CS50 Introduction to Computer Science course.

# Part 1: C
## Problem Set 1
- Implement some basic programs in C:
  - [hello world](pset1/hello/hello.c)
  - [mario](pset1/mario/more/mario.c) prints out a pyramid of `#` symbols
  - [credit](pset1/credit/more/credit.c) identifies a credit card provider by the card number
  
## Problem Set 2
- [Brute force password cracker](pset2/crack/crack.c)
- [Vigenere cipher encoder](pset2/vigenere/vigenere.c)

## Problem Set 3
- Implement a few [helper functions](pset3/music/helpers.c) for a music synthesiser

## Problem Set 4
- [Edit hex codes in raw BMPs to reveal a hidden image](pset4/whodunit/whodunit.c)
- [Script for Resizing BMP files](pset4/resize/resize.c)
- [Recover data from a "corrupted" memory card](pset4/recover/recover.c) by scanning for JPEG headers

## Problem Set 5
- Implement [spell checker](pset5/speller/dictionary.c)
  - Load dictionary data from text file into hash table
  - Perform case-insensitive spelling checks on strings
  - Optimise load, check and unload times
  
# Part 2: Python

## Problem Set 6
- Repeat majority of C exercises [in python](pset6/)

## Problem Set 7
- Build [Flask app](/pset7/finance/application.py) that simulates stock exchange
  - Allows buying and selling of shares using real (historical) stock data
  
## Problem Set 8
- Build [Flask app](/pset8/mashup/application.py) which pins news stories to a map
